To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        outsidetextfont\n            Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying outside the\n            sector.\n        pull\n            Sets the fraction of larger radius to pull the sectors\n            out from the center. This can be a constant to pull all\n            slices apart from each other equally or an array to\n            highlight one or more slices.\n        pullsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `pull`.\n        rotation\n            Instead of the first slice starting at 12 o'clock,\n            rotate to some other angle.\n        scalegroup\n            If there are multiple pie charts that should be sized\n            according to their totals, link them by providing a\n            non-empty group id here shared by every trace in the\n            same group.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        sort\n            Determines whether or not the sectors are reordered\n            from largest to smallest.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.pie.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each sector. If\n            trace `textinfo` contains a \"text\" flag, these elements\n            will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`\n            contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set,\n            these elements will be seen in the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `textinfo`.\n        textinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on the graph.\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `textinfo`.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. variables `label`, `color`, `value`,\n            `percent` and `text`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.pie.Title` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        titlefont\n            Deprecated: Please use pie.title.font instead. Sets the\n            font used for `title`. Note that the title's font used\n            to be set by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.\n        titleposition\n            Deprecated: Please use pie.title.position instead.\n            Specifies the location of the `title`. Note that the\n            title's position used to be set by the now deprecated\n            `titleposition` attribute.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        values\n            Sets the values of the sectors. If omitted, we count\n            occurrences of each label.\n        valuessrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `values`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        \nDid you mean \"hole\"?\n\nBad property path:\ncolors\n^^^^^^"
